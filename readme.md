## Features

- `ZScan#scan`/`ZScan#skip`/`ZScan#match_bytesize` accept either string or regexp as param.
- `ZScan#pos` is the codepoint position, and `ZScan#bytepos` is byte position.
- Correctly scans anchors and look behind predicates.
- Pos stack manipulation.

## Install

```bash
gem ins zscan
```

## Typical use

``` ruby
require 'zscan'
z = ZScan.new 'hello world'
z.scan 'hello' #=> 'hello'
z.skip ' '
z.scan /\w+/   #=> 'world'
z.eos?         #=> true
```

## Motivation

Ruby's stdlib `StringScanner` treats the scanning position as beginning of string:

```ruby
require 'strscan'
s = StringScanner.new 'ab'
s.pos = 1
s.scan /(?<a)/ #=> nil
s.scan /^/     #=> ''
```

But for building parser generators, I need the scanner check the whole string for anchors and lookbehinds:

```ruby
require 'zscan'
z = ZScan.new 'ab'
z.pos = 1
z.scan /(?<a)/ #=> ''
z.scan /^/     #=> nil
```

## Essential methods

- `ZScan.new string, dup=false`
- `#scan regexp_or_string`
- `#skip regexp_or_string`
- `#match_bytesize regexp_or_string` return length of matched bytes or `nil`.
- `#eos?`
- `#string` note: return a dup. Don't worry the performance because it is a copy-on-write string.
- `#rest`

## Pos management

- `#pos`
- `#pos= new_pos` note: complexity ~ `new_pos > pos ? new_pos - pos : new_pos`.
- `#bytepos`
- `#bytepos= new_bytepos` note: complexity ~ `abs(new_bytepos - bytepos)`.
- `#advance n` move forward `n` codepoints, if `n < 0`, move backward. Stops at beginning or end.
- `#reset` go to beginning.
- `#terminate` go to end of string.

## Efficient pos stack manipulation

- `#push` push current pos into the stack.
- `#pop` set current pos to top of the stack, and pop it.
- `#drop` drop top of pos stack without changing current pos.
- `#restore` set current pos to top of the stack.
- `#clear_pos_stack` clear pos stack.
- `#try` try to do several scans in the given block, fall back to init pos if block returns `nil` or `false`. Returns block's return, can be nested.

## String delegates

- `#<< append_string`
- `#[]= range, replace_string` note: if `range` starts before pos, moves pos left, also clears the stack.
- `#size`
- `#bytesize`
